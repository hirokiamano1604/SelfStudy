## Essay（20分 — 280語を目安に止める）

### Introduction（2文: 背景の言い換え + 立場）
Nowadays, some people claim that having a temporary job enable people to be free in terms of a time flexibility. On the other hand, the others state that teh salary of gig-workers are unstable which directly lead to insecure financial conditions. I think this way of working is relatively better, bacause the unemployed rate is going to increase as AI develop in the future.　


### Body Paragraph 1
First of all, gig workers tend to have more time flexibility than the other office workers.
In general, people with a secured job are forced to work for 8 hours per day.
On the other hand, gig workers can choose when they work and be able to spend time for their hobbies other than jobs.
Gig workers are free from the constraint which office workers daily have.
For exmple, office workers in Japan have to engage in their work for 8 hours and sometimes additional hours.
The freedom of time is the big advantage that gig workers have.

### Body Paragraph 2
However, gig-worker are more likely to be enemployed.
In japan, people are not easily unemployed because there is a strong barrier which secures the employemnt of labors.
Unlike them, there is only a weak contract between the gig workers and the managing company, which in turn means that they are likely to get layoff.

### Conclusion（新情報を入れない。要約 + 立場の再確認）
On balance, this way of working is one of the great options.
These days, as AI evolves, demand for human labor is decreasing. 
Getting job by this way protect themselves by being alternated by AI, and it is one of surviving strategy in 21st centuries.
